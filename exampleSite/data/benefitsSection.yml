- content: 'SIPs have fantastic insulation and eco qualities: less waste is produced when ew build with SIPs & very little energy is used during the manufacturing process. On top of this, the panels are made by sandwiching a core of rigid EPS foam insulation between two structural skins of oriented strand board (OSB), meaning that in building with SIPs, the insulation is already in place. Our SIPS buildings are more energy efficient, stronger, quieter and more airtight than older technologies. Less air leakage means less drafts, fewer noise penetrations and significantly lower energy bills, thus a reduction in CO2 emissions.

- content: 'First, longevity. Metal roofing and siding are lifetime products. Second, no painting or maintenance. The metal is delivered factory painted. Number three is efficiency. Theres a radiant barrier given the air gap behind the metal. Fourth, is the speed of install. Five, the metal panel is 30 to 60% recycled content. At the end of its life, it will still be valuable and not end up in landfill. Six, no rot. Seven, its easy to clean with a quick power washing. Eight, hail and fire resistance.
